# snake-game
You might remember the snake game that we played as kids on our 1 inch screen phones back in the day. Yeah that one where the snake grows each time it eats and gets killed if it bites the walls or its own tail. I thought it would be a fun exercise to code it to play in the linux terminal with basic c without the use of any graphics. So I went on and did it in about 3 days. It is working pretty well. You might want to check it out if you have a linux terminal.
